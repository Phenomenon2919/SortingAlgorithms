Individual programs in C language for sorting algorithms given:
1) Bubble sort
2) Selection sort
3) Insertion Sort
4) Quick Sort
5) Merge Sort
6) Heap Sort

File "fsorting.c" has code for all the above said algorithms
The purpose of this file is to calculate the execution time for all the algorithms for comparing
The execution time is calculated for 10000, 100000 & 1000000 elements for all the algorithms
The output for this program is given in "fileSort.txt"
